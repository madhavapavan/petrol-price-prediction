# Petrol Price Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a project that aims to analyze and predict petrol prices in India. It includes a set of scripts, data files, and analysis notebooks used to understand the trends in fuel pricing and build models to predict future prices.

## Files in the Project

- **`1_basics_on_petrol_prices_in_india.ipynb`**: 
  This Jupyter notebook contains the initial analysis and exploration of petrol price data in India. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

- **`petrol.csv`**: 
  This CSV file contains historical petrol price data in India. The dataset includes columns such as date, location, and price.

## Key Objectives
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the trends in petrol prices over time.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Processing the data and creating meaningful features to feed into predictive models.
3. **Modeling**: Using machine learning techniques to build models for predicting future petrol prices.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madhavapavan/petrol-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. **Install required libraries**:
   You can install the necessary Python libraries using pip. Make sure you have `python` and `pip` installed.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter notebook**:
   You can open the Jupyter notebook using the following command:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 1_basics_on_petrol_prices_in_india.ipynb
   ```

4. **Run the analysis**:
   Follow the steps in the notebook to explore and analyze the petrol price data, and experiment with building predictive models.

## Installation Requirements
To install the dependencies for this project, use the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include dependencies like:
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
```

## Future Work
- Implement advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the prediction accuracy.
- Include more features like weather, GDP, and other economic indicators that might affect petrol prices.
- Extend the analysis to predict fuel prices in different states of India.
